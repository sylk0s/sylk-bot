# sylk-bot

Personal, general use discord bot:
Currently has:
- voting (data backed up in firestore)
- pin command

Right now I'm implementing all of the base quacon features in this bot as well, but later I hope to fork those into it's own repository and keep developing this into a more general purpose bot.
